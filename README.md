In this React program we go through several languages including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As well in this app I will be using several dependancies for more information on those check the package.json file. With in the application we are able to go through several pages, authentication, and managing tickets. as an unauthorized user you are able to view my home, about and services page, while once signed in you are able to make, edit, and delete tickets

Some things I would like to look into adding in the future is: 
    -fixing the carousel so the image in the carousel is also the background imgage and is blured on the sides
    -a admin page where the admin is the only one to be able to edit, and delete tickets
    -a user permissions page to be able to easily edit users admin status
    -a no match page
